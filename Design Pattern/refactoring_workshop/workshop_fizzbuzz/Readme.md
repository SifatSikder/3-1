1.Inappropriate Naming: The function name say is not related to the print Fizz,Buzz,FizzBuzz word so I replace this name with printAppropriateString()



2.Dead Code: If a number is divisible by 3 and also divisible by 5 then it is automatically divisible by 15 so the condition of divisible by 15 is deadcode and hence will never be used
